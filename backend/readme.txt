MERN project so therefore used with mongodb atlas
first if we clone this project then you type the terminal as npm install so all node_module are install .Please
make sure you are currently in the root directory of project.
********************Project start**********************

first we create a model for UserModel, TaskModel, ProjectModel in the models folder.

In model i realize that the start date and end date are same so is there another option to create another model
and used as a reference from the other model like the same as in staff_id reference. 

After model i create a controller and routes and pass the file on the server.js. 

finally i test with the postman and if any error i check with the console.log() function to determine where
my error are held or why i am not receiving any data .

///////
config.env file to secure the database
